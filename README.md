## ⚠️ Known Issue

Due to layout and scaling differences across browsers, the site may appear slightly zoomed (around 20% larger) when viewed at 100% zoom in some browsers like Chrome or Brave.

For the best experience:
- Set browser zoom to 80%
- Or use Live Server (in VS Code) for correct local rendering

This issue is related to layout width and scaling, and I'm actively working on making the layout fully responsive without needing zoom adjustments.
